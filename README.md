## OUR TEAM'S WORKFLOW

### FRIDAY 30TH JUNE 2023

##### :fire_engine: CHALLENGES TODAY: :fire_engine:

- One member pulled out before meeting the rest of the team
  **6:00PM to 6:30PM - Meet & Greet with your group:**
  Join us in the webinar first, and from there you’ll be allocated into your groups and can practise using the huddle function to meet your group, get to know each other a little, and have a quick chat about the brief.
  We spent this time introducing ourselves, when we graduated from GA, which class we took and the tech stack we were all confident in using.
  **6:30PM to 7:00PM - Introduction to the brief**
  This will be your formal introduction to the brief. We’ll give you all the details of what we expect to see on Sunday, and you’ll be able to ask any questions. We’ll also explain how to speak with the mentors throughout the weekend.
  Since 2 of our Software Engineers are confident in using REACT the team decided they would be the ones to lead and mentor the Junior Software Engineers who weren't comfortable with using React.
  The team was quick to hunt down reference material and define the kind of agency we wanted to be, really focusing on **Empowering Women in Tech**.
  **7:00PM to 8:00PM - Panel discussion**
  As soon as the panel was over our team went straight to work with planning our roles and MVP.

### SATURDAY 1ST 2023

##### :fire_engine: CHALLENGES TODAY: :fire_engine:

- One member struggled to get their part completed due to not knowing how to use REACT
- One of the most knowledgable members wasn't available until late into the evening so the remaining experienced Dev took on the heaviest workload on top of being the mentor for the junior dev of the team
- The only UX Designer had a huge workload to do alone
- Struggling **HARD** with getting the website responsive
- Fell behind schedule to the point that the team fears that there is nothing to present on Sunday
- MVP has not been hit yet
  MORNING SPRINT QUESTIONS:

1.  What did you do since we last spoke?
2.  What problems did you run into?
3.  Esther's UX approval?
4.  What needs to be changed?
5.  Do you need to pair up with someone or can you do it alone?

    We made sure that we approached each other with the understanding that we are all at different levels in our Tech Journey's and chose to use this as a chance to learn how we can share our experiences and strengths.
    Our Logo also was born today:
